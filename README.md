# Twitter-X-Sentiment-Analysis
_**//This is an University project**_
This project aims to provide insight into the emotions expressed via tweets during the COVID-19 period of 2021.

We used the VADER sentiment tool for analysis, which gave us an accuracy of 88% when the emotions were categorized into "Positive", "Neutral" and "Negative". This tool is specifically curated to analyse the sentiments expressed on social media platforms, such as Twitter (now X).
